# TODO

Before next installation update the script with the following items:

## More or less organized

- dotfiles using chezmoi

- mac settings
  - Accessibility
    - reduced motion ON
    - shake mouse pointer to locate OFF
- post install, manual steps (that could be possibly automated)

  - [ ] ssh-keys
    - [ ] [github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

- [ ] Obsidian: copy notes from iCloud/documents and create vault
- [ ] BetterTouchTool: give permissions, import presets (dotfiles), import license (1Pass)
- [ ] Logtech login to sync settings
- Calibre
- Raycast - create global shortcut
- [ ] enable apps from Setapp

  - Import settings
  - [ ] KarabinerElements: give permissions, then complex Modifications > map capslock to powerkey

- [ ] Ensure Ethernet has higher priority than WiFi (System Preferences > Network > gear icon > Set Service Order)

- Fonts
  - iA Writer https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts
  - Fira Code font

## Maybe next time

- Migration Assistant - maybe it could be useful when I'll be migrating my personal laptop, because when I tried to use
  it for the one for my company, I couldn't transfer System Settings, because they're managed by admins.
